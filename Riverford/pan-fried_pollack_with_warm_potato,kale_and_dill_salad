Boil the potatoes in a pan of salted boiling water for 8-10 mins, until tender.

Drain the potatoes and add them to the dressing while stil warm.
Add raw kale, season and stir.
Sprinkle the flour over the fish skin and season.
Heat a little oil in a heavy-based non-stick frying pan.
Add the fish,
skin side down and leave to cook on a medium heat for approx 3-4 mins for a 2-3cm thick fillet.
