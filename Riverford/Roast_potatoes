Use the floury varieties like King Edward and Sant√® if you can get them, although any potato will roast.

Peel and chop them into 3 or 4 pieces, depending on size.
Boil in salted water for 7-8 mins and once drained, toss them in the colander to fluff them up.

Heat you fat (ideally goose or duck fat for a really good flavour) in the roasting tin in the oven before adding the potatoes.
Sprinkle them with sea salt to crisp them up.

Good things to add to roast potatoes:
  rosemary
  garlic
  thyme
  bay leaves
  sesame seeds
  parmesan
  saffron (steep a pinch in 1 tbsp boiling water, then add the liquid to the roasting tin with the potatoes)
