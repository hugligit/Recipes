Serves- 4

Ingredients:
  1 lb trout (bones and head removed)
  ½ cup pecans
  1 tsp flour
  ½ tsp salt
  1 egg white, slightly beaten
  2 tbsp butter divided
  ¾ cup fresh squeezed orange juice
  1 tsp chopped fresh or dried rosemary

Rinse trout and pat dry with paper towels.
In a food processor, finely grind pecans with flour and salt.
Brush egg white on flesh side of trout.
Coat trout by sprinkling nut mixture onto flesh and pressing firmly.

In a large non-stick skillet or heavy skillet coated with cooking spray, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat.
Add trout, flesh side down.
Cook until pecans are lightly browned, about 6 minutes.

Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, bring orange juice and rosemary to boil over medium-high heat.
Lower heat to medium and simmer for a few minutes until sauce is slightly reduced.
Add remaining 1 tablespoon butter, stirring until melted.
Reduce heat to low to keep sauce warm.

Transfer trout to plates (cut them in half down the middle, if desired), pecan side up and drizzle with orange rosemary sauce.
