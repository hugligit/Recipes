Makes- 8

Ingredients:
  pastry:
    500g plain flour
    250g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice
    1 tsp sea salt
    2 egg yolks
    6-8 tbsp cold water
  filling:
    200g swede, peeled weight cut into 1 cm dice
    100g carrot, peeled weight cut into 1 cm dice
    100g parsnip or celeriac, peeled weight cut into 1 cm dice
    100g onion, peeled weight cut into small dice
    150g stilton or other blue cheese, crumbled
    sea salt
    ground black pepper
    1 egg, beaten

Put the flour, butter and salt in a food processor.
Pulse until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs.
Add the egg yolks and pulse to combine (don't over-mix).
Gradually add the water.
Stop pulsing the moment it looks as if it's starting to come together.
Transfer to you work surface or a bowl and form into a ball (press it together rather than kneading it).
Wrap in clingfilm and chill in the fridge for at least 30 mins; ideally for an hour or two.
In a large bowl mix the filling together, seasoning well, particularly with pepper.
Split the pastry into 8 similar sized pieces.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll out each piece into a circle.
Divide the pastry mixture between the pastry.
Fold up the sides and press together, crimping as you go.
If the pastry splits slightly press it back together.
Place on a baking tray lined with baking parchment (not greaseproof paper).
Bake at 170Â°C for 45-50 mins until golden.
