Serving: 6

Ingredients:
  1.7 kg leg of lamb, shank on
  1 onion, washed
  1 leek, trimmed
  1 carrot, peeled
  good sprig thyme
  3 bay leaves
  3 stems parsley
  1 tsp whole peppercorns

  Riverford caper sauce

Tie the herbs together in a bundle.
Wash the onion and (unless very grubby) leave the skin on as it lends colour to the stock.
Place the lamb in a large pan together with onion, trimmed leek, carrot, peppercorns and herb bundle.
Cover with water and bring to the boil slowly.
After a few minutes at a simmer some scum and fat will result on the surface, spoon this off and add mor water to cover if necessary, return to a simmer.

Cook like this for 2½-3 hours, turning the leg accasionall and replacing evaporated liguid.
For the ½ hour you may like to remove the stock vegetables and poach sovegetables (like carrots, leeks, whole shallots) to accompany the lamb.
Lift the lamb to a warm plate to carve.
Strain the stock and add some to the caper sauc if you would prefer it thinned-save the rest for soup or casserole making. Serve slices of pauched lamb and vegetables with crushe potatoes and caper sauce.
