Prep:
  Keep in the fridge or in a cool damp place.
  You don't have to peel them; you can just scrub them well with a veg brush.
  They discolour quickly so put cut or peeled artichokes in a bowl of water with a good squeeze of lemon juice to stop this happening.
Cooking:
  To roast, cut them into wedges or large chunks.
  Toss in just enough olive oil to coat and season with salt and pepper.
  Roast for 30-40 mins at 200Â°C.
  Add a little chopped garlic and rosemary too.
  Try them roasted in salads with pears, blue cheese, walnuts and winter salad leaves.

  Or you can eat them raw: slice them thinly into salads or with dips.
