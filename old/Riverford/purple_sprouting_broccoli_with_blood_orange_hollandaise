Serves- 4

Ingredients:
  zest of blood orange
  125ml blood orange juice
  2 egg yolks
  2 tbsp cold water
  450ml melted unsalted butter (prepared in jug)
  fine sea salt
  350-400g purple sprouting broccoli

Put the orange zest and juice in a small pan, bring to boil and reduce the liquid to approx 2-3 tbsp.
Strain through a piece of muslin and discard the zest.
Put the egg yolks and water in a heat proof bowl that sits snugly over a pan of barely simmering water (Your bowl should not touch the water).
Whisk until the volume has doubled and the mixture has thickened.
Remove from the heat and whisk for 20-30 secs.
Return to the heat.
Very gradually whisk in the melted butter, until the sauce has the consistency of double cream.
If the sauce starts to thicken too much and look like it might curdle, take it of the heat for a min and keep whisking in butter to let in cool slightly (If the mixture curdles, you can try to rescue it by breaking another egg yolk and gradually whisk into the curdled mixture (keep an eye on the temperature)).
Stir in the strained orange juice and season with salt to taste (if you sauce is looking a little thick as you whisk in the butter, you may wish to add the juice at an earlier stage to help).
Add a squeeze of lemon if you want to sharpen it slightly.
Leave the sauce in the bowl over the pan to keep it warm but take of the heat.
In a pan of boiling water cook the purple sprouting broccoli for 3 mins.
Drain.
Season and serve with a little sauce drizzled over.
