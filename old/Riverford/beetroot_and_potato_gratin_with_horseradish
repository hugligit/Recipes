Serves- 6 (as a side)/2-3 (as main with a green salad)

Ingredients:
  150ml double cream
  100 ml milk
  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  2 bay leaves
  leaves from 3 sprigs thyme
  2 tsp creamed horseradish
  sea salt
  ground black pepper
  500g potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
  500g beetroot, peeled and thinly sliced

Preheat the oven to 170Â°C.
Put the cream, milk, garlic, bay leaves and thyme in a pan.
Heat gently for a couple of mins until steaming.
Remove from heat and leave to infuse for 10 mins.
Discard the bay leaves.
Stir in horseradish and season.
Layer the potato and beetroot in a baking dish.
Pour over the cream mixture and turn the veg over to coat it.
Cover with foil and bake for 1 hour.
Uncover and bake for another 15-30 mins (if it looks like it is browning to much cover back up with foil), until the veg is tender (time varies depending on the thickness of slices).
