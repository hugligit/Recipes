Ingredients:
  Sugar Syrup:
    500g sugar
    300ml boiling water
    Â½ lemon juiced
  Caramel:
    100g sugar
    2tbsp water

Start with the sugar syrup.
Mix the sugar with the water and stir before adding lemon juice.
Make sure the sugar has disolved.

To make the caramel, place the sugar and water in a pot and allow to melt.
Do not stir the sugar but you can gently shake the pot.
Once the caramel is golden, add the syrup.

Do not stir but give it another shake and leave it to thicken.
Once it has thickened place in steralized jars (you can do this by boiling them in water for 10 minutes) and leave to cool.

If it is runnier than the desired consistency, you can put it back in the pan to simmer for a bit longer.
If it is to thick, make some more sugar syrup and stir it into the golden syrup.
