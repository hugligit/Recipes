Ingredients:
  3½cup (420g) flour (NOT all purpose flour)
  3 finger pinch salt
  1 cup (236.588ml) egg whites
  1 pound (453.592g) chilled butter

Add the salt and egg whites (you can use water as a replacement) to your flour and mix them all together.
If the dough is to sticky and more flour.
Once the dough is properly mixed, take it out onto the worksurface and knead it before placing it in the fridge to chill.

Prepare your butter and squash it into a square roughly ½ inch thick.
Place back into fridge.

Roll your dough to about ⅛ inch thick leaving the middle of the slightly thicker.
Place the butter in the centre of the dough and fold the dough over making sure there are no air bubbles.
Gently press down on the folds to remove air bubbles and secure the folds.
Then roll out the dough into a long rectangle, fold into thirds, turn 90° and repeat.

After this, fold into thirds and place to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes.
Repeat this 3 more times.

After you have have completed the process for the last time (4 times in total) and rested it, roll it out to the desired length and width.
Now you can bake it in the oven until crisp, flakey and golden.
