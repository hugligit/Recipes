-----------------------------------------

Serves: 4

Ingredients:
  1 onion finely chopped
  25g butter
  2 apples
  2 pears
  15g sage leaves, coarsely chopped
  salt
  pepper

A rough guide for roasting you pork is to rub with sea salt then roast at 220°C for 10 minutes, then 180°C for 15-16 mins per 500g; test and if cooked through rest for 10 minutes before carving.

Meanwhile, softern the onion in the butter over a low heat for a few minutes, don't allow it to colour.

Peel and core the apples and pears and chop into 1cm dice.
Add the sage and fruit to the onion and turn together with a splash of water and then cover and cook for 5 minutes until the fruit is tender but still holds together.
Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste and serve with thick slices of roast pork and sauce with the meat juices.
