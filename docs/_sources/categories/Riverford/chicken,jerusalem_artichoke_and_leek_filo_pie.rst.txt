  1 heaped tsp dijon mustard
  leaves from 4 sprigs of fresh thyme

Cut the artichokes into wedges and put ina bowl with a squeex of lemon to stop them discolouring.
Boil in salted water for approx 8 minutes until just tender.
Drain.
Heat the oil in a heavy-based pan.
Fry the chicken for a few mins on each side to brown and just cook through.
Remove to a plate.
Add the butter, leeks, sage and flour and cook, stirring for a couple of minutes.
Gradually add the milk, stirring, until starting to thicken.
Add the artichokes, chiken, mustard and thyme.
Season.
Cool, then transfer to a pie dish.
Take a sheet of filo, brush lightly with butter and place it flat on top or the pie mixture to cover it.
Working with one sheet at a time tear the filo into thin strips and use to make a ruffle pattern to cover the pie.
Aim for a couple of layers or ruffled pastry.
Brush with melted butter as you make each layer.
Bake at 180Â°C for 45mins until golden.
