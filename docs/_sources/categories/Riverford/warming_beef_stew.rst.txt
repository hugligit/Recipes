Serves- 4

Ingredients:
  3 tbsp oil (for frying)
  500g diced beef, suitable for stewing
  2 tbsp plain flour
  1 tsp english mustard powder
  1 onion, roughly sliced
  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped
  eyeballed (3 cm??) fresh ginger, peeled & grated
  1 tsp paprika
  2 carrots, chopped in 1-2 inch pieces
  1 small swede, peeled & chopped
  350ml beer
  300ml beef stock
  400g tinned tomatoes (chopped)
  sea salt
  ground black pepper

Preheat the oven to 150Â°C.
In a flame and ovenproof casserole dish, heat 2 tbsp oil and fry the beef until brown on all sides.
Add the flour and mustard and cook for a couple more mins.
Remove the beef, add a little more oil and fry the onion for a few mins to soften them.
Add the garlic, ginger, paprika, carrots and swede and cook for a couple more mins.
Put the beef back in the pan, with the beer, stock and tomatoes.
Season.
Heat until bubbling, then cover and transfer to the oven for 2-3 hours.
Test it after 2 hours and cook for longer if needed, until the meat is very tender.
Keep an eye on the liquid and top up with a little more stock if needed.
