    400g tin chopped tomatoes
    black pepper
    handful basil leaves
    20g grated cheese

In a bowl, mix together the mashed potato flour and half the beaten egg.
If it seem  bit dry and crumbly, add some more egg to help bind it together.

Roll out the potato mixture into sausage shapes with you hand.
Use a teaspoon to cut each potato 'sausage' into 2-3cm pieces until you have loads of mini dumplings.

Press the back of a fork onto each gnocchi to make a pattern.
Put them on a plate, ready to cook later

Now make the sauce.
Fry the onion and garlic in oil for about 4 minutes until they go soft.
Add the tomatoes, season with pepper and simmer for 25 minutes.
Stir in the basil leaves.
Keep the sauce warm while you cook the gnocchi.

Fill a pan with water and bring it to a simmer.
Then, drop in the gnocchi and cook for 2-3 minutes.
When they are ready, they will float up to the top of the pan.
Drain the gnocchi, then serve with the tomato sauce and grated cheese.
