Spaghetti_Carbonara
-------------------

Serves- 1

Ingredients:
  25g butter
  20g flour
  250ml milk
  50g cheese
  25g ham/pancetta/bacon
  25g spaghetti pasta

Cut the bacon into small chunks and fry until crispy, leave to one side.
In a saucepan add the butter and let it melt.
Add the flour and stir to prevent it from burning.
It will appear thin but DO NOT add more flour as it will thicken when you add the milk
Take of the heat and slowly add the milk, stirring as you add to prevent lumps.
Once you have added to milk you may season the roux sauce to taste.
It should appear a little runny, do not worry as when you later add cheese the sauce will thicken due to melting cheese.
Gently heat the sauce and set some water to boil.
When the water is boiling but your spaghetti in and let it cook.
In the meantime, add your cheese and bacon slowly to your sauce, making sure to mix it in uniformly.
Once your spaghetti is cooked (al dente or your preference), drain it using a colander and add to your sauce.
Mix it in, season to taste and serve.
