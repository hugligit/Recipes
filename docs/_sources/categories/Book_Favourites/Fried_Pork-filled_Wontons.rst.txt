* 2.5 cm piece fresh root ginger grated 
* 1 garlic clove peeled and crushed
* 1 small egg lightly beaten
* 1 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp soft light brown sugar 24-30 wonton wrappers 8 cm ²
* 300 ml vegtable oil for deep frying For the ginger dipping sauce:
* 4 tbsp soy sauce 1-2 tsbp rice or raspberry vinegar
* 2.5 fresh root ginger peeled and finely silvered
* 1 tbsp sesame oil
* 1 tbsp soft light brown sugar 2-3 dashes hot chili sauce spring onions
*   to garnish
    
Method:
  
Place all the filling ingredients into a food processer and, using the
pulse button, until well blended.  Do not overwork, the filling should
have a coarse texture.

Lay out the wonton wrappers on a clean chopping board and a teaspoon of
filling in the centre of each.  Brush the edge with a little water and
bring up two oppisite sides of each square over the filling to form
a triangle, pressing the edges firmly to seal.  Dampen the other two edges
and overlap them slightly, pressing firmly to seal, to form
a open-envelope shape, sisimilar to a tortenllini.

For the dipping sauce, stir all the ingridients together until the sugar
has completely dissolved.  Then, pour the dipping sauce into a serving
bowl and reserve for later.

Heat the oil in a large wok to 190°C or until a small cube of bread browns
in about 30 seconds (meaning it is hot enough) Working in batches of 5-6,
fry until the wontons are crisp and golden turning them once or twice.
Remove and drain on a absorbent kitchen papers.  Garnish with the spring
onion tassels and serve hot with the dipping sauce.
