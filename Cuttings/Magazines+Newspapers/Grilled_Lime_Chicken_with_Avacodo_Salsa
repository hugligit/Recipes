Serves- 6

Ingredients:
  1½-2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breast
  2 tbsp+1 tsp lime juice (2 limes), divided
  1 tbsp olive oil
  ½ tsp kosher salt
  2 avocados, diced or mashed or 1 pkg. vacuum-packed guacamole
  1 vine ripened tomato, diced
  ¼ red or yellow onion, finely diced (about ½ cup)
  1 tbsp chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Place the chicken breasts in a flat dish with sides just large enough to hold them in a single layer.
Add 2 tablespoons of lime juice, oil and kosher salt and flip chicken several times to coat well.

In a medium serving bowl, combine avocados, tomato, onion and salt and mix thoroughly.
Add cilantro, if using, and remaining teaspoon of lime juice.

Heat indoor grill pan of a heavy skillet to medium-high.
Cook chicken for 4-5 minutes per side until it start to brown on the outside and is no longer pink inside the thickest part, about 165°F on a meat thermometer.
