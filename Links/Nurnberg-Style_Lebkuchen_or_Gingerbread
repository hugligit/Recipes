Ingredients:
  400g ground almonds
  100g candied orange
  100g candied lemon
  200g raisins
  4 eggs
  ½ cup brown sugar
  ½ cup honey
  20ml rum
  100g butter
  1 tbsp cinnamon
  1 tbsp Lebkuchen mix
  ½ pack baking powder
  oblaten/round wafer
  Lebkuchen mix:
    2 tbsp cinnamon
    2 tsp ground cloves
    ½ tsp ground allspice
    ¼ tsp ground nutmeg
    ½ tsp ground coriander
    ½ tsp ground cardamom
    ½ tsp ground ginger
    ½ tsp ground anise seed

Combine the raisins, candied orange and lemon together and shred into a food processor until it becomes a rough and very sticky mass.
Pour into a bowl of appropriate size add almonds, rum, cover with kitchen foil and let it stay overnight.

On the next day, add cinnamon, Lebkuchen mix and baking powder to the mixture.
Beat the eggs.
Melt the butter and sugar and let it cool off a little.
Stir in eggs, butter and honey and mix until you have medium soft and very sticky batter.

Since the batter is soft and can not be rolled out or shaped by itself, the Nürnberg Lebkuchen is baked over the oblaten.
Oblaten is very thin (about 1 mm) wafer, usually round.

Place about 2 tablespoon of sticky batter over the wafer base.
With a spoon of finger, dipped in water to avoid sticking, shap the Lebkuchen by gently pushing the batter to the wafer's edges until and even lay of about 1cm of batter covers it.
Place on baking sheet.
Let the Lebkuchen rest for half an hour, decorate with almonds and bake in a preheated to 180°C/875°F oven fo 15-20 minutes.
If you do not have oblaten or similar wafer, shap the batter into balls, bake them on a baking sheet and gentlyh remove, once they cool off.

Dip the cookies in cocolate of sugar glaze if you wish.
