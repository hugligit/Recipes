Serves- 4

Ingredients:
  ⅓-½ cup fresh live juice (2 limes)
  2 tbsp brown sugar
  4 tbsp reduced-sodium soy sauce
  2 tbsp peanut/vegetable oil
  1 lb top sirloin steak (or boneless, skinless chicken breasts
  2 cups shredded carrots
  2 scallions, sliced
  1 large pink or red grapefruit, peeled and divided into segments, membranes removed
  1 small head Boston lettuce, torn into pieces (about 6 cups)
  ½ cup chopped fresh cilantro/basil (optional)

In a medium bowl, whisk lime juice, sugar, soy sauce and oil.
Lay steak in a flat dish with sides, pour half the mixture over it and flip it to coat the meat thoroughly.
Set it aside and reserve remaining marinade to use as a dressing for the salad.

Meanwhile, in a salad bowl, combine carrots, cilantro (if using), scallions, grapefruit and lettuce.

Heat a heavy skillet over medium high.
Remove steak form marinade (you can discard the marinade or boil it for 2 minutes and use as a steak dipping sauce), and cook for 4-5 minutes per side until cooked to desired doneness.
If the outside of the steak is cooking too quickly, reduce the heat and partially cover the pan.

Transfer the steak to a cutting board, allow to cool slightly and slice across the grain into ½inch-wide strips.
Dress salad with reserved marinade (not the marinade for the steak (safety reasons)).
Serve salad topped with slices of steak.
