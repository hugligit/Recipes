Serves- 2

Ingredients:
  1 chicken breast (you can use thigh instead if you want)
  1 small onion, chopped
  1 clove of garlic
  25g butter (for frying you can replace with oil)
  1 chicken stock cube
  100ml boiling water
  100ml coconut milk
  2 tsp curry powder (you can use mild or strong and vary how many teaspoons you use)
  1 tsp turmeric powder
  (1 tbsp?) flour
  1 tbsp natural yoghurt

In a jug, mix 100ml of boiling water and stock cube and set aside.
Dice your onion and crush your garlic and set aside.
Chop your chicken into medium/small even chunks of a similar size.
Melt the butter in a large saucepan on a medium heat until sizzling.
Add the curry powder and turmeric powder to the pan and allow them to cook for a short while without burning.
Add the chicken and cook over a medium heat until browned and no pink is showing.
Add the onion and garlic to the sauce pan and cook until soft, around 3 minutes.
Add flour to thicken the sauce and make sure it does not clot or burn.
Add the stock and coconut milk to the pan.
Turn down to a low heat and leave to simmer for 15 minutes or until your thickest chunk of chicken is cooked through.
Remove from heat and stir in yoghurt (Note: this is an optional step and can be skipped).
Mix well and enjoy!
