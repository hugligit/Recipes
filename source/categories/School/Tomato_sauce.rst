Ingredients:
  tomatoes/chopped tomatoes (tinned) (the number varies depending on how much you want)
  any herbs you would like in the sauce
  salt (if you want it)
  garlic (if you want it)
  (basically, put in what you want)

If you're using tomatoes bake them until their skin starts to wrinkle or you can move it up and down with your fingers (whichever happens first).
Then peel away the skin and let the tomatoes cool.
Once cold, chop them up (NOTE: you can just use the flesh, or deseed the cores and use them as well or use the entire tomato seeds and all, it is all up to you).
If you are using the ones in the tin you're job is simpler, open the tin.

Heat a little oil in a pan and add the tomatoes.
Fry them for a while and help break them down in the pan with the spatula.
Add any fresh ingredients now (such as garlic or fresh basil) so they can break down.
Cook the sauce helping the ingredients break downing the pan until it becomes a uniform paste.
Add the herbs and season to taste.
