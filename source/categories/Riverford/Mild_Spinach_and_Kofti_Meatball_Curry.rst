-------------------------------------

Serves- 4

Ingredients:
  450g kofti meatballs
  250g spinach, blanched, squeezed & chopped
  4 tomatoes, seeded & chopped
  1 onion chopped
  2cm³ ginger chopped
  2 cloves garlic, crushed
  1 tbsp mild curry paste
  2 tbsp olive oil
  3 tbsp double cream
  salt
  pepper
  1-2 tsp Garam Masala

Pre heat the oven to 180°C.

Make a basic curry paste by blending the onion,garlic ginger and mild curry paste together in a processor with a little water.
Brown the meatballs briefly in olive oil, remove with a slotted spoon and transfer to a casserole.
Now fry off the curry paste for about 5 minutes over a fairly gentle heat so as not to colour the onion.
Add the spinach and tomatoes, stir in the cream, and bring to a simmer.
Pour over the kofti.

Put the lid on and place into the oven for about 20 minutes until the kofti are cooked through.
Remove the lid and season with salt, pepper and a sprinkling of Garam Masala and serve with hot nan bread or plain boiled rice.
