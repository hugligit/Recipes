Preheat the oven to 180Â°C.
Whisk the egg whites withe the vanilla ectract until light and fluffy-you want to stop before they reach soft peak stage so don't get too carried away.

Place the icing sugar, rice flour and ground almond into a bowl and whisk briefly to mix and get rid of lumps and bumps.
Make a well in the centre and pour in the cooled melted butter-stur wigorously to incorporate.
Add in a large spoonful of the beaten egg white, stir well to slacken the mixture before adding the remaining egg white.
Be gentle when stirring through the egg whites, do this with a flexible spatula.

Divide the mixture amongst the cases and then pop into each a few blueberries-not too many, they will sink into the misture.
Sprinkle over with a little caster sugar if you like, it willgive a cruncy crysatl surface.
Bake for about 15-20 minutes of until cooked through and golden.
Touch in the centre and if springy they're done.
Allow the friands to cool in ther cases before unmoulding.

Now place some frozen berries in a frying pan with a knob of butter, heat until the defrost and begin losing their juices, dredge with icing sugar to taste an serve a spoon of warm fruit sauce beside 1-2 friands topped with clotted cream.
