-----------------------------------------

Serves:4

Ingredients:
  4 red peppers
  1 onion, halved & finely sliced
  2 cloves garlic, crushed & finely chopped
  3tbsp olive oil
  16 black olives
  4 anchovy fillets, cut into small pieces
  1tbsp capers, rinsed
  1tbsp balsamic vinegar
  salt
  pepper
  1tbsp oregano leaves

Grill the peppers until the skin blackens and blisters then remove form the grill and sit in a plastic bag for a few minutes to cool a little.
They will have collabsed and now be safe to peel without danger of burnin yourself.
If you don't leave in the bag it becomes very difficult to remove the skin.
Peel away the papery skin, split and remove seeds then cut into strips.

Cook the garlic and onion in the olive  oil slowly and gently until it is soft and golden then stir in red pepper strips and blsamic vinegar.
Add the olives, capers, anchovy and seasoning to taste.
Serve with thinly sliced cold roast beef and scatter with fresh oregano leaves.
